# BSc_Thesis
The SNP_regression_with_plink.R contains the source code for the thesis work.
The application requires Plink 1.9 and R 4.0.2. It is recommended to use Rstudio for possible troubleshooting.
The phenotype input data need to be ".csv" format with "." decimal point and ";" separator. See Dummy_Pheno_data.csv for example.
The installed plink version needs to be inside the working directory (this can be set in the application).
